In this Document we have listed the (potential) names of styles to replace the original set with. 
The reason we have different names than the base game RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 is so you can use both OpenRCT2's official soundtrack aswell as RCT2's official soundtrack without it getting confusing. If the game is standalone and RCT2 is not loaded in the game it will fall back onto the following styles:
